      Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with
      code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also
      have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like
      semantics. Defining classes Classes are in fact "special functions", and
      just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, the
      class syntax has two components: class expressions and class declarations.
      Class declarations One way to define a class is using a class declaration.
      To declare a class, you use the class keyword with the name of the class
      ("Rectangle" here). class Rectangle { constructor(height, width) {
      this.height = height; this.width = width; } } Copy to Clipboard Hoisting
      An important difference between function declarations and class
      declarations is that while functions can be called in code that appears
      before they are defined, classes must be defined before they can be
      constructed. Code like the following will throw a ReferenceError: const p
      = new Rectangle(); // ReferenceError class Rectangle {} This occurs
      because while the class is hoisted its values are not initialized. Class
      expressions A class expression is another way to define a class. Class
      expressions can be named or unnamed. The name given to a named class
      expression is local to the class's body. However, it can be accessed via
      the name property. // unnamed let Rectangle = class { constructor(height,
      width) { this.height = height; this.width = width; } };
      console.log(Rectangle.name); // output: "Rectangle" // named Rectangle =
      class Rectangle2 { constructor(height, width) { this.height = height;
      this.width = width; } }; console.log(Rectangle.name); // output:
      "Rectangle2" Copy to Clipboard Note: Class expressions must be declared
      before they can be used (they are subject to the same hoisting
      restrictions as described in the class declarations section). Class body
      and method definitions The body of a class is the part that is in curly
      brackets {}. This is where you define class members, such as methods or
      constructor. Strict mode The body of a class is executed in strict mode,
      i.e., code written here is subject to stricter syntax for increased
      performance, some otherwise silent errors will be thrown, and certain
      keywords are reserved for future versions of ECMAScript. Constructor The
      constructor method is a special method for creating and initializing an
      object created with a class. There can only be one special method with the
      name "constructor" in a class. A SyntaxError will be thrown if the class
      contains more than one occurrence of a constructor method. A constructor
      can use the super keyword to call the constructor of the super class.
      Static initialization blocks Class static initialization blocks allow
      flexible initialization of class static properties including the
      evaluation of statements during initialization, and granting access to
      private scope. Multiple static blocks can be declared, and these can be
      interleaved with the declaration of static properties and methods (all
      static items are evaluated in declaration order). Prototype methods See
      also method definitions. class Rectangle { constructor(height, width) {
      this.height = height; this.width = width; } // Getter get area() { return
      this.calcArea(); } // Method calcArea() { return this.height * this.width;
      } } const square = new Rectangle(10, 10); console.log(square.area); // 100
      Copy to Clipboard Generator methods See also Iterators and generators.
      class Polygon { constructor(...sides) { this.sides = sides; } // Method
      *getSides() { for (const side of this.sides) { yield side; } } } const
      pentagon = new Polygon(1,2,3,4,5); console.log([...pentagon.getSides()]);
      // [1,2,3,4,5] Copy to Clipboard Static methods and properties The static
      keyword defines a static method or property for a class. Static members
      (properties and methods) are called without instantiating their class and
      cannot be called through a class instance. Static methods are often used
      to create utility functions for an application, whereas static properties
      are useful for caches, fixed-configuration, or any other data you don't
      need to be replicated across instances. class Point { constructor(x, y) {
      this.x = x; this.y = y; } static displayName = "Point"; static distance(a,
      b) { const dx = a.x - b.x; const dy = a.y - b.y; return Math.hypot(dx,
      dy); } } const p1 = new Point(5, 5); const p2 = new Point(10, 10);
      p1.displayName; // undefined p1.distance; // undefined p2.displayName; //
      undefined p2.distance; // undefined console.log(Point.displayName); //
      "Point" console.log(Point.distance(p1, p2)); // 7.0710678118654755 Copy to
      Clipboard Binding this with prototype and static methods When a static or
      prototype method is called without a value for this, such as by assigning
      the method to a variable and then calling it, the this value will be
      undefined inside the method. This behavior will be the same even if the
      "use strict" directive isn't present, because code within the class body's
      syntactic boundary is always executed in strict mode. class Animal {
      speak() { return this; } static eat() { return this; } } const obj = new
      Animal(); obj.speak(); // the Animal object const speak = obj.speak;
      speak(); // undefined Animal.eat() // class Animal const eat = Animal.eat;
      eat(); // undefined Copy to Clipboard If we rewrite the above using
      traditional function-based syntax in non–strict mode, then this method
      calls are automatically bound to the initial this value, which by default
      is the global object. In strict mode, autobinding will not happen; the
      valu
